## Typeset a PhD Dissertation With Published Papers and New Material

Do you want to write a lovely introduction to your PhD dissertation, design a pretty cover, design nice chapter cover pages, and embed the published PDFS from your papers into the file? And do you need it to comply with Harvard's typesetting standards from 2022? You, my friend, are in luck! Check out the slightly modified [Overleaf Template Here](https://github.com/ReallyMcCoy/McCoy_PhD_Dissertation/tree/main). You can see my full typeset dissertation [here](https://www.codymccoy.com/files/McCoy_Dissertation_Illustrations_FINAL.pdf).

## Use FDTD Modeling for Biology

Check out the [primer](https://www.codymccoy.com/files/FDTD_Methods_Primer_MICRON_2021.pdf) that Anna  Shneidman, Alex Davis, Joanna Aizenberg and I wrote on finite-difference time-domain optical simulations for biology. In particular, review the flow chart Anna designed in Figure 2 to help you decide whether to use FDTD (or another method).
