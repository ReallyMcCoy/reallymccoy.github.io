About me
======

I am a PhD student in [David Haig](https://haiggroup.oeb.harvard.edu/)'s lab at Harvard, supported by the NDSEG Fellowship and the Ashford Fellowship. I am broadly interested in:
- biomaterials, such as antireflective architecture in nature (super black birds and spiders)
- evolutionary arms races and conflicts of interest (e.g., in sexual selection and pregnancy)

Before Harvard, I studied biology at Yale (advised by [Leo Buss](https://eeb.yale.edu/people/faculty-affiliated/leo-buss) and [Rick Prum](https://prumlab.yale.edu/)) and received an MPhil in enviromental policy from Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar.
