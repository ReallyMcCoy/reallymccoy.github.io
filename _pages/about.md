About me
======

I am a PhD student in [David Haig](https://haiggroup.oeb.harvard.edu/)'s lab at Harvard, supported by the NDSEG Fellowship and the Ashford Fellowship. I researc evolutionary biology. 

I am broadly interested in biomaterials, such as antireflective architecture in nature (super black birds and spiders), and evolutionary arms races and conflicts of interest (e.g., in sexual selection and pregnancy).

Before Harvard, I studied biology at Yale (advised by [Leo Buss](https://eeb.yale.edu/people/faculty-affiliated/leo-buss) and [Rick Prum](https://prumlab.yale.edu/)) and received an MPhil in enviromental policy from Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar.
