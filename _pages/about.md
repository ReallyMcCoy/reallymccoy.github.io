About me
======

I am a PhD student in [David Haig](https://haiggroup.oeb.harvard.edu/)'s lab at Harvard, supported by the NDSEG Fellowship and the Ashford Fellowship. Before this, I studied biology at Yale (advised by [Leo Buss](https://eeb.yale.edu/people/faculty-affiliated/leo-buss) and [Rick Prum](https://prumlab.yale.edu/)) and received an MPhil in enviromental policy from Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. I am broadly interested in:
- biomaterials, such as antireflective architecture in nature (super black birds and spiders)
- evolutionary arms races and conflicts of interest (e.g., in sexual selection and pregnancy)  


Research Topics

*Super Black*
-------

**Birds of Paradise**
[![Birds of Paradise have super black color](/images/Birds_of_Paradise_Website.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02088-w)
Male birds-of-paradise, perhaps nature's most ornate and elaborate creatures, evolved ultra-dark super black framing brilliant color. Unlike typical feathers, the feathers of super black plumages have 3-D microstructures on their barbules which multiply scatter, and iteratively absorb, nearly all light.

**Peacock Spiders**

Peacock spiders have evolved ultra-dark black color adjacent to their brilliant color patches. They are a remarkable convergence of form-- microlenses, used in nature on everything from plant leaves to moth eyes-- and function-- ultra black near bright color for color emphasis, akin to their ecological analogues (the Birds-of-Paradise).

**Convergence of Super Black in Many Birds**
[![Many bird evolved super black color](/images/Convergent_Evolution_Birds_Website.png)](https://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/18/jeb208140)
Super black plumages evolved in birds from 15 families, with diverse morphology underpinning the plumages. Several families convergently evolved similar morphologies (e.g., curved, uwpard-branching barbules).
