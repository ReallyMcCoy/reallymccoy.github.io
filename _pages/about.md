Currently, I am a [Stanford Science Fellow](https://stanfordsciencefellows.stanford.edu/meet-fellows) (coadvised by [Jen Dionne](http://dionne.stanford.edu/) and [Steve Palumbi](https://hopkinsmarinestation.stanford.edu/people/stephen-palumbi)), with additional support through the [NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503622) (advised by [Sonke Johnsen](https://opticsoflife.org/)). I recently graduated with a PhD from [David Haig](https://haiggroup.oeb.harvard.edu/)'s lab at Harvard, supported by the NDSEG Fellowship and the Ashford Fellowship. Before this, I studied biology at Yale (advised by [Leo Buss](https://eeb.yale.edu/people/faculty-affiliated/leo-buss) and [Rick Prum](https://prumlab.yale.edu/)) and received an MPhil in enviromental policy from Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. Through the Climate Solutions Living Lab at Harvard Law School, [Wendy Jacobs](https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10426/Jacobs) taught me how to apply science to issues of environmental policy. She passed away this year, leaving a giant-sized positive imprint on the world through her law, teaching, and advocacy.
