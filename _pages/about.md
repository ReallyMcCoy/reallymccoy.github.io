About me
======

I am a PhD student in [David Haig](https://haiggroup.oeb.harvard.edu/)'s lab at Harvard, supported by the NDSEG Fellowship and the Ashford Fellowship. Before this, I studied biology at Yale (advised by [Leo Buss](https://eeb.yale.edu/people/faculty-affiliated/leo-buss) and [Rick Prum](https://prumlab.yale.edu/)) and received an MPhil in enviromental policy from Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. I am broadly interested in:
- **Optics and Light-Harnessing in Nature:** how living creatures-- such as super black birds, super black spiders, and photosynthetic reef animals-- manipulate light
- **Game Theory in the Life Sciences:** arms races and conflicts of interest (e.g., in pregnancy and at an ecosystem level) 
- **Ecosystem Health:** what makes ecosystems stable versus susceptible to environmental change?

*Super Black: Natural Light Traps*
-------

**Birds of Paradise**
[![Birds of Paradise have super black color](/images/Birds_of_Paradise_Website.png)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02088-w)
Male birds-of-paradise, perhaps nature's most ornate and elaborate creatures, evolved ultra-dark super black framing brilliant color. Unlike typical feathers, the feathers of super black plumages have 3-D microstructures on their barbules which multiply scatter, and iteratively absorb, nearly all light.

**Peacock Spiders**

Peacock spiders have evolved ultra-dark black color adjacent to their brilliant color patches. They are a remarkable convergence of form-- microlenses, used in nature on everything from plant leaves to moth eyes-- and function-- ultra black near bright color for color emphasis, akin to their ecological analogues (the Birds-of-Paradise).

**Convergence of Super Black in Many Birds**
[![Many bird evolved super black color](/images/Convergent_Evolution_Birds_Website.png)](https://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/18/jeb208140)
Super black plumages evolved in birds from 15 families, with diverse morphology underpinning the plumages. Several families convergently evolved similar morphologies (e.g., curved, uwpard-branching barbules). 

*Game Theory: Manipulating Light to Manipulate Others*
-------

**Carotenoid Signals in Tanagers**
[![Tanagers have microstructures to enhance pigment](/images/Tanagers_Website.png)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/799783v3)
Male, but not female, tanager feathers have elaborate microstructures which amplify the saturation of red, orange, and yellow colors. These colors are produced by carotenoid pigments, classically thought to be honest signals of quality.

**Embryo Selection and Mate Choice**
[![Embryo selection and mate choice](/images/SignalsDegrade_Website.png)](https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(19)30344-1)
Just as females screen potential mates under many metrics, human mothers unconsciously screen embryos for quality. ‘Examinees’ are under intense selection to improve test performance by exaggerating formerly ‘honest’ signals of quality. By the  ‘proxy treadmill’, new honest indicators arise while old degraded indicators linger, resulting in trait elaboration. Hormone signals during pregnancy show extreme evolutionary escalation (akin to elaborate mating displays).

**Marmosets: Conflict Between Twins**
[![Marmosets](/images/Marmosets_Website.png)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajp.23038)
Primates are model organisms for questions of cooperation and conflict within families,and callitrichines (marmosets, tamarins, and lion tamarins) frequently bear litters of two or more. We (project co-led by Dr. Brett Frye) compiled a large dataset of nine species of callitrichines (n  = 27,080 individuals) and found two indications of sibling conflict: (i) Singletons have higher survivorship than litter‐born monkeys and outperform their litter‐born peers on two measures of reproductive success, and (ii) offspring born into mixed‐sex litters reproductively outperform those born in all‐male or all‐female litters in some species, suggesting that same‐sex competition may limit fitness outcomes.

*Ecosystem Health: Data-driven Environmental Policy*
-------

**Urban Trees: Biodiversity, Ecology, Stability**
Urban forests can be biodiverse ecosystems. My team and I (project co-led by Ben Goulet-Scott) have assembled a dataset of over 5 million city trees from many of the the 150 largest cities in the USA, including data on species, exact location, condition, and trunk diameter. Early results indicate that west coast cities have very low levels of native trees, while midwestern US cities range from 50%-80% native. Our analyses will next consider biome, change over time, biodiversity, and equity. Ultimately we will publish a paper, a public dataset, and recommendations for urban policy. Most recently, we met with the Cambridge city government urban forest team.
