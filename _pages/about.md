Nature is interdisciplinary. Ecological systems are forged in the evolutionary crucible which freely mixes biology with mathematics, chemistry, physics, and geology. To understand the secrets of nature and ensure a sustainable future, we must venture between traditional disciplinary boundaries. I work at the nexus of data science, applied physics, and evolution to research and protect two critical ecosystems: coral reefs and urban forests. Previously, my team and I discovered “super black” birds and spiders that reflect <0.5% of incident light-- work that inspired new solar panel materials and will appear in a forthcoming United Nations booklet on bioinspiration for sustainable design. First-author papers from my projects have appeared in <i>Nature Communications</i>, <i>Trends in Ecology and Evolution</i>, and <i>Current Biology</i>.

Currently, I am a [Stanford Science Fellow](https://stanfordsciencefellows.stanford.edu/meet-fellows) (coadvised by [Jen Dionne](http://dionne.stanford.edu/) and [Steve Palumbi](https://hopkinsmarinestation.stanford.edu/people/stephen-palumbi)), with additional support through the [NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503622) (advised by [Sonke Johnsen](https://opticsoflife.org/)). David Haig supervised my PhD at Harvard, where I was an NDSEG Fellow and the Ashford Fellow. Before that, I studied biology at Yale (advised by Leo Buss and Rick Prum) and received an MPhil in enviromental policy as a Rhodes Scholar.

My work falls into four main projects: the City Trees Project (data-driven ecology of more than 5 million urban trees across the USA); the Optics of Coral Reefs (the physical structure of marine photosynthesis and photonic drivers of coral bleaching); Super Black Animals (intricate light-harnessing structures in birds and spiders which inspired new solar panel materials); and the Biology of Pregnancy (data-driven analyses of the fundamental risks and conflicts of interest in mammalian pregnancy).

These projects may seem broad, but they are intimately connected. By studying fantastic ornaments in birds and spiders, I acquired the tools in computational optics to research photosynthesis in threatened coral reef ecosystems. After researching genetic conflicts in human pregnancy, I launched a project on host-symbiont conflict as a cause of coral bleaching nad gained the data science skills to research urban forestry. My research philosophy can be summed up in one sentence, oft repeated by my PhD supervisor David Haig: it is worth our while to focus on the fundamental interconnectedness of all things.
