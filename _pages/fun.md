## Bookbinding

At Harvard, I taught bookbinding courses in the [Bow and Arrow Press](https://www.instagram.com/bowarrowpress). My students made amazing hand-bound copies of works by Oscar Wilde, Lewis Carroll, Simone de Beauvoir, their own family's recipe books, Shakespeare, and more. Below are images of a few books I have bound over the years.

## Music

During my PhD, I sang with the Boston-based a cappella group Voicelab. You can listen to some of our tracks on Spotify (samples below), or watch socially-distanced youtube videos we made during Covid ([here](https://youtu.be/-NaooJ1f80U) and [here](https://youtu.be/pYXwrJKEn04)).
